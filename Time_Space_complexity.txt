**Time and Space Complexity Analysis**
Each recursive call to the `reverse_string()` function will create 
a new set of local variables - first_char, the_rest, sub_string, and reversed_substring. 
Therefore, the space complexity of a recursive function would always be proportional to the 
maximum depth of recursion stack.  
The time complexity for this function will be  O(k*n), where k is a constant and n is the 
number of characters in the string (depth of recursion stack).
